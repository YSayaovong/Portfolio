                <h3>Mechanical Designer to Software Engineer</h3>
                <p>
                  As a dedicated Mechanical Designer with four years of hands-on experience, I am now transitioning into a Software Engineer role, bringing a unique blend of engineering expertise and programming skills. I thrive in fast-paced environments where problem-solving and innovation are key, and I am passionate about building effective, scalable solutions that make an impact.
                </p>
                <h3>Programming Skills & Tools</h3>
                <p>
                  I have developed strong proficiency in Python, with foundational knowledge in C++, C#, and working knowledge of databases such as MySQL, SQL, and NoSQL. My background in mechanical design, utilizing tools like SolidWorks, AutoCAD, and CREO 8.0, has sharpened my analytical skills, enabling me to approach complex software challenges with a fresh perspective.
                </p>
                <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                <p>
                  Bilingual in English and Hmong, I bring strong communication skills and a collaborative mindset to any team. As I continue to expand my expertise in cloud technologies, microservices, and containerization, I am looking to apply my diverse skill set in a programming role.
